            <p>My name is Patrick Shea, I am 28 years old born and raised in Georgia. I am the only person in my family
                born outside of New York or Maryland. My dad's side of the family is from and resides in New York,
                where my mom's side of the family is from and lives in Maryland.</p>
            <p>I have one brother named Christian who is 7 years older than me. My girlfriend is Casey and we have been
                dating over two years. We have two dogs, Blue and Millie and currently live in Buckhead.</p>
            <p>I work for a software company in Marietta working in Client Services, and Casey is a Medical
                Esthetician. I decided to go back to school to learn development in order to progress a start-up, while
                Casey begins Nursing School in January, 2019. Over the next two years we plan on changing careers, and
                moving to Colorado.</p>
